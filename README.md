Design Decisions:

I made certain design decisions to make Jihn Wock an exciting and challenging game for players. The pixelated art style and the use of a biker as the main character was inspired by the John Wick movie series. 
The decision to include a gun for the player character and med kits dropped by enemies was made to increase the game's action and challenge. 
The use of a boss at the end of every level adds a climactic ending to each level and increases the game's overall difficulty.

Controls:

A & D or Left & Right Arrows: Move player left and right
Spacebar: Jump
Additional Information:

To start the game, double-click on the "Jihn Wock" executable file.
The game consists of multiple levels, each with a unique environment.
If the player's health reaches zero, the game ends, and the player must restart from the beginning of the level.
The player's health can be restored by picking up med kits dropped by enemies.

I hope you enjoy playing Jihn Wock and have fun defeating all the enemies and bosses!
